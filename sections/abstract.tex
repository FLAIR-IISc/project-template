\begin{abstract}
    Abstract goes here. 
    The idea of the abstract is to provide a high-level 
    pitch, or summary, of the project. Every single IISc student 
    should be able to understand most of it.
    Remember you can not add all the details here. 
    You have to be succinct, willing to sacrifice the details.
